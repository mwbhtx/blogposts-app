# Blog Posts

Blog Posts is a full-stack SPA developed to experiment with various aspects of web development such as database management and user security. My goal for developing Blog Posts was to learn how to implement a MongoDB database as well as user account management / authentication techniques. For starters, user account passwords are stored using bcrypt and authentication / authorization is managed using web sessions / cookies.
